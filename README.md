## Pirates TCG Player

This app let play the One piece TCG game on your mobile device and PC.

The main purpose of this project is to make reliable the game without owning the cards or going to a local tournament.
The main goal of this project is to let you play the game (of course!) and to allow to let ready to play the new expansions easily (and also for me to insert with a little time effort ;) )

The main core of the project is the parser. The app allow to translate directly the card effect text directly into a tree to action that can be interact in the match playground.

The app is in a very early stage of development, so the main features are not implemented yet.
